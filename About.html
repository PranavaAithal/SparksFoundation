          <h2>Welcome to EHF Donations!</h2>
          <p>
            At EHF Donations, we are committed to improving the lives of disadvantaged children by putting 
            an emphasis on their education, health, and nutrition. Regardless of their socioeconomic status, 
            we passionately believe that every child deserves equal opportunity and the ability to succeed.
            <br>Our goal is to empower and elevate poor children by giving them access to a top-notch education, 
            crucial medical treatment, and wholesome food. We think that education is the key to ending the 
            cycle of poverty and that a child's whole development is fundamentally impacted by their 
            physical and nutritional health.
